# Data-scrapping-and-performing-EDA
I have Gathered the data using using urlopen from urlib.request and beautifulsoup from bs4 library.
Used paytm Mall website to gather the data by inspecting the html code and finding the appropriate nodes in the class to fetch the right data.
I am currently using the Manual method to fetch the data aiming to use selenium to automate the process
Combined the CSV files using Pandas library in Python 
Performed basic cleansing of Data. Added categorical columns based on the Numerical Columns to perform a better EDA analysis
